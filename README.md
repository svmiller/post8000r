# post8000r

These are supporting materials (likely just example data sets, but we'll see) for POST 8000, a graduate class on quantitative methods for public policy analysis. I chose to create an R package to house the data sets I want to use for this class.

How to install my bad R package:

```R
devtools::install_github("svmiller/post8000r")
```
